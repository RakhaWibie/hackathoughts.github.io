- tip: Watch for hackers with multiple dietary restrictions! You might have a halal option and a gluten-free option, but have you provided for a hacker who said they were halal and gluten-free?

- tip: Try offering a sponsorship tier that's much higher than all the others. This makes your other tiers look like a great deal in comparison. (Of course, your perks at this top tier will have to be very, very good.)

- tip: "Hot take: Don't require resume uploads. We all know the sponsors want them, but by requiring them you're excluding underclassmen who may not have a resume yet, anyone who doesn't want to share their information, and anyone who may feel insecure about their resume. One professor of mine who teaches intro classes has shared that the resume requirement was one of the biggest obstacles to participation for many of his students. To strike a balance with the need to give sponsors hacker information, you could have a freeform text field in your registration form asking people to detail any experience they have - frame this question as one that helps the organizers tailor the event to its participants, which, of course, it does. Or for a true opt-out you could ask people to upload a document saying 'I do not want to share my information' - this prevents lazy people from just hitting an opt-out button because they don't want to dig up their resume."
